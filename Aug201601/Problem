Watson gives Sherlock an array  A of length N. Then he asks him to determine if there exists an element in the array such that the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right. If there are no elements to the left/right, then the sum is considered to be zero. 
Formally, find an i , such that, A1 + A2 ... + Ai-1 =  Ai+1 + Ai+2 ... + AN.
Input Format 
Array of N positive integers.
Output Format 
Write unit tests to validate the input. 
Constraints  
1<= N <=105
1<= Ai <= 2*104
1<= i <= N
Sample Input
Input 1: 1,2,3
Input 2: 11,20,8,31
Sample Output
TEST CASE: FAILED
TEST CASE: PASSED
Explanation 
For the first test case, no such index exists. 
For the second test case,A[1] + A[2] = A[4] , therefore index 3 satisfies the given conditions.
